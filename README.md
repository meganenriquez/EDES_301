<h1>EDES_301</h1>

This class is my introduction to Practical Electrical Engineering
I got to create two main projects!
- Project 1: Embedded System, I made a "Touching Grass Timer" that aids stressed students with a guided breathing LED and an indicator of their heart-rate, reminding them they are alive | see the [blog post](https://www.hackster.io/me52/edes-301-touching-grass-timer-f0ae02)
- Project 2: PCB design, I used EAGLE to design a PCB for an Etch-A-Sketch that's ready for manufacturing

Taking EDES 301 was the reason I created a github account, but I hope to continue using this tool for the future!
